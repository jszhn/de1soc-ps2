## ps2-de1-soc
PS/2 protocol interface utilities and functions. Built for Terasic's DE1-SoC development platform, with an Altera Cyclone V FPGA. May not work for other development platforms (i.e., DE10, DE2). Verilog may work with some minor changes. This repository includes:
* SystemVerilog hardware interface
* C embedded software interface
* Nios II interrupt-based interface
